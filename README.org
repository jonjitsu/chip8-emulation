| 0x000-0x1FF | original interpreter (should not be used by programs) |
|       0x200 | Start of most programs                                |
|             |                                                       |

|       0xE9F | End of program code                                   |

| 0xF00-0xFFF | Display buffer                                        |

** Registers
- 16 8bit registers (V0-VF)
- VF flag register for some instructions (should not be used by any program)
- 1 16bit register called I for memory addresses
- 2 8bit registers for timers (delay and sound) [when > 0, then decremented at rate of 60hz)
- 1 16bit PC Program counter (not accessable)
- 1 8bit stack pointer (not accessable)

** Stack
- An array of 16 16bit values.
- used for subroutine return addresses.

** Keyboard
16-key hexadecimal keypad
| 1 | 2 | 3 | c |
| 4 | 5 | 6 | D |
| 7 | 8 | 9 | E |
| A | 0 | B | F |

** Display
64x32 pixel monochrome display
| (0,0) |         |
|       | (63,31) |

ETI 660: 64x48 & 64x64 models

Uses sprites for drawing.
8 pixels in width
8x15 byte max size
drawn in XOR mode
when a bit is erased in buffer VF gets set to 1 (used for collision detection)


Chars 0 - F are represented by sprites 5 bytes long (8x5) stored within the 0x00-0x1FF area



** Timers & Sound
*** Delay timer (DT)
Active when > 0
dec 1 from DT at 60Hz
When DT eq 0 then deactivate.

*** Sound timer (ST)
Active when > 0
dec 1 from DT at 60Hz
if ST>0 sound buzzer
When ST eq 0 deactivate

Only 1 sound produced and it's undefined. (use 440Hz (A))

** Instructions
35 16bit instructions
